# Server Operator's Manual

While we at Auki Labs run several Hagall servers in multiple regions on AWS, we allow anyone to become a Hagall server operator and help us run part of the posemesh infrastructure.

After TGE, server operators will be rewarded with tokens for participating. At a later stage, we plan to reward operators based on traffic served.

If you have spare compute resources, enough bandwidth and wish to become a Hagall server operator, please see the deployment methods below for instructions on how to get started.

If you are running into problems, you can report them as [issues](https://github.com/aukilabs/hagall/issues) here on GitHub or talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/aukiverse).

**It is important that your server is running 24/7 without interruption. When a server with active participants is shut down, the participants will lose their session, which give them a bad experience. Thus servers that misbehave will be delisted and not receive any more incoming traffic.**
